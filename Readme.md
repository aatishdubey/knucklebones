# Rules

- Click "Roll" to roll the dice. The dice roll can give any number between 1 to 6.
- On each player's turn, click on a column on your squares to place the number in. The number is added to the first row of the column.
- The game ends if either one of the player's fills up all their boxes.
- Scores are calculated for each column. If there are multiple occurances of a number in the one column, the number is squared or cubed based on number of occurances (2 or 3)
